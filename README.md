# RFM-Analysis
RFM Analysis is used to understand and segment customers based on their buying behaviour.
# Overview
RFM Analysis is a concept used by Data Science professionals, especially in the marketing domain for understanding and segmenting customers based on their buying behaviour.

Using RFM Analysis, a business can assess customersâ€™:

Recency (the date they made their last purchase)
Frequency (how often they make purchases)
and Monetary value (the amount spent on purchases).
# Objective
To perform RFM analysis using Python, we need a dataset that includes customer IDs, purchase dates, and transaction amounts. With this information, we can calculate RFM values for each customer and analyze their patterns and behaviours.
# Output 
RFM Analysis is used to understand and segment customers based on their buying behaviour. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary value, which are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.
